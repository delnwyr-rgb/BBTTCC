  "backstory": "Marcus Kane was born into nobility before the Great Collapse, but emerged as a true leader in the post-apocalyptic world. His tactical genius and natural charisma made him invaluable to the Iron Dominion Faction. As a Territory Commander, he's responsible for managing multiple settlements and defense networks across the faction's holdings. His exposure to Tikkun energy has enhanced his strategic thinking and given him an almost supernatural ability to predict enemy movements. He's known for turning small outposts into thriving settlements and has never lost a territory under his direct command.",
