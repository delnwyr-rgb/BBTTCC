# BBTTCC Tikkun: The Great Work v4.8.1-ENHANCED

**The Sparks of Light System - Spiritual Victory Condition for BBTTCC Campaigns**

## üåü Overview

BBTTCC Tikkun implements "The Great Work" - a profound spiritual victory condition that transforms your BBTTCC campaign from strategic conquest into a journey of world healing and personal growth. Based on the Kabbalistic concept of **Tikkun Olam** (repairing the world), this system challenges players to gather scattered "Sparks of Light" through righteous action and character development.

## ‚ú® What is The Great Work?

The Great Work is the ultimate goal of a BBTTCC campaign: to repair the "shattered human Sephira" - a broken divine lens that fractured reality itself. Players must gather Sparks of Light tied to the **10 Sephiroth** from the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, each representing a divine virtue they must embody to heal both the world and themselves.

### Core Philosophy

- **Thematic Tension**: Your character's assigned Sparks are the **opposite** of your starting strengths
- **Personal Growth**: Victory requires overcoming ego and developing complementary virtues
- **Moral Consequences**: The **how** matters more than the **what** - corrupt methods taint Sparks
- **Collaborative Victory**: All players must complete their Constellations for the final ritual

## üéØ Key Features

### Procedural Constellation Generation
- **Unique Path for Every Character**: Sparks assigned based on Archetype, Crew, Occult Association, and Background
- **Thematic Coherence**: A Warlord must learn Mercy, a Scholar must find Wisdom's balance
- **Minimum 3-5 Sparks**: Ensures meaningful character arcs

### Three Types of Sparks
1. **Conceptual Sparks** üí≠: Achieved through specific scenario outcomes (Justice, Mercy, Truth)
2. **Vestigial Sparks** üìú: Physical artifacts hidden in ancient ruins and forgotten places  
3. **Animate Sparks** üë§: Living beings who embody divine principles and must be convinced

### Five Spark States
- ‚ö´ **Required**: Destined but not yet discovered
- üîç **Identified**: Nature revealed through investigation
- ‚ú® **Active**: Quest currently underway
- üåü **Gathered**: Successfully integrated through righteous action
- üíÄ **Corrupted**: Tainted by improper methods, requires purification

### Corruption & Purification System
- **Moral Enforcement**: Wrong methods (violence for Mercy, lies for Truth) corrupt Sparks
- **Redemption Paths**: Corrupted Sparks require specific purification quests
- **Meaningful Consequences**: Corruption affects faction standing and blocks final victory

## üìä API Documentation

### Core API Access
```javascript
const api = game.bbttccTikkun.api;
```

### Character Constellations
```javascript
// Generate constellation for character
await api.generateConstellation(actor);

// Get character's spark data
const sparks = api.getSparks(actor);

// Get specific spark
const spark = api.getSpark(actor, 'sparkOfMercy_Chesed');

// Update spark status
await api.updateSparkStatus(actor, sparkId, 'gathered', {
    entry: 'Completed diplomatic resolution with Justice outcome'
});
```

### Automated Integration
```javascript
// Listen for scenario completion (automatic checking)
Hooks.on("bbttcc:scenarioResolved", (scenarioData) => {
    // System automatically checks gathering/corruption conditions
});

// Manual condition checking
await api.checkForGathering(actor, {
    type: 'Courtly Intrigue',
    outcome: 'Justice/Reformation',
    details: 'Peaceful resolution'
});
```

### Progress Tracking
```javascript
// Campaign-wide progress overview
const progress = api.getSparkProgress();

// Constellation completion check
const isReady = game.bbttccTikkun.constellation.isConstellationComplete(sparks);

// Data validation and repair
const repaired = await api.repairSparks(actor);
```

## üîç GM Tools & Diagnostics

### Built-in Diagnostics
```javascript
// Run full system test
bbttccTikkunTest();

// Check module status  
const isReady = game.bbttccTikkun.api.isReady();

```

### Common GM Actions
- **Generate Hints**: Provide guidance for stuck players
- **Apply Corruption**: Consequence for improper methods
- **Manual Progression**: Skip phases or force advancement
- **Data Export**: Backup constellation progress

## üé® Customization

### Spark Conditions
The system includes extensive mapping of scenario outcomes to gathering/corruption conditions. GMs can modify these in `tikkun-api.js`:

```javascript
const conditionsMap = {
    'sparkOfMercy_Chesed': {
        gather: ['Justice/Reformation', 'Alliance/Cooperation'],
        corrupt: ['Retribution/Subjugation', 'Betrayal']
    }
    // Add custom conditions here
};
```

### Visual Theming
All styling is contained in `tikkun-styles.css` with CSS custom properties for easy color scheme modification.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### ‚ùå "Module not ready" Error
- **Cause**: Initialization timeout or missing dependencies
- **Solution**: Ensure bbttcc-factions is enabled first, refresh Foundry

#### ‚ùå No Constellation Generated
- **Cause**: Insufficient character creation data
- **Solution**: Ensure Archetype, Background, or Class are set; use manual generation

#### ‚ùå Sparks Not Updating
- **Cause**: Inter-module communication failure
- **Solution**: Check that other BBTTCC modules are emitting scenario resolution hooks

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in module settings or console:
```javascript
game.modules.get('bbttcc-tikkun').flags.debug = true;
```

## üîÑ Integration with BBTTCC Suite

### Automatic Event Listening
- **bbttcc-factions**: Monitors War Log for corruption tracking
- **bbttcc-raid**: Receives raid outcomes for Spark progression
- **bbttcc-territory**: Tracks Administrative actions for governance Sparks
- **bbttcc-radiation**: Future integration planned for purification themes

### Faction Rewards
Gathering Sparks provides massive Organization Point bonuses:
- **Spark of Mercy**: +50 Diplomacy, +25 Soft Power
- **Spark of Severity**: +50 Violence, +25 Discipline  
- **Spark of Understanding**: +50 Economy, +25 Intrigue

### Hex Bonuses
Gathered Sparks allow permanent Sephirothic alignment of controlled territories, providing lasting mechanical benefits.

## üéØ Design Philosophy

The Great Work transforms BBTTCC from a game about conquering the wasteland into a game about **healing** the wasteland. Every tactical decision becomes a moral choice, every character build becomes a journey of growth, and every victory requires wisdom rather than just strength.

This system proves that the greatest enemies are not external threats, but our own pride, fear, and ego - and that true victory comes not from defeating others, but from perfecting ourselves.
